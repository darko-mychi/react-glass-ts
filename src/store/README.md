# Store

This store directory is based on the VueX store and is powered by the warp utility in `GlassX.js`. GlassX allows you to break up your store into modules which allows you to have states and reducers defined in a more readable and friendly manner.

GlassX relies on [reactn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactn) and so after creating your glassX store, you can use `useGlobal` and all other reactn methods to mutate and read your global state.
